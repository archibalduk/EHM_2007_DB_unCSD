# EHM 2007 DB unCSD (aka Custom Start Date Database Reversal Tool)
A tool for converting a pre-CSD Patch database to a vanilla EHM 2007 database. Prior to the release of the Custom Start Date Patch, Eastside Hockey Manager 2007 databases were adjusted each year in order to reflect the real life ages/seasons using the fixed 2006/07 start date. E.g. players would be aged 2 years in the database to reflect the 2008/09 starting season using the fixed 2006/07 start date.

DB unCSD will convert a year adjusted database in order to reflect that any starting season can now be selected in EHM 2007 using the Custom Start Date Patch.

This tool was last compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio 2013.
